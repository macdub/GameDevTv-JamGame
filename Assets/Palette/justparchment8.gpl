GIMP Palette
#Palette Name: JustParchment8
#Description: This is my first palette and it is a small 8 colour palette I've made for paper and ink / parchment style designs. To be used for things like old scrolls and maps and to give the feel of old fasioned ink on parchment drawings.Â <p>I made it by taking various stock images of old scrolls and maps and condencing the colours down then tweaking them to work with my sprites.</p><p>Any comments or suggestions for improvment would be greatly appriciated.</p><p></p>
